# Quarkus JDBC SQLITE Driver Extension

This Quarkus extension wraps the JDBC SQLite driver and performs some build time code patching to make sure that the
driver can be used with native images.

## How to use it

Currently the only way to use this extension is to build it from the source code and then reference it in your
application

## Future work

- Publish to Quarkiverse or to Maven Central
